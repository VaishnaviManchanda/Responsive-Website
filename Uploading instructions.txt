Hey, You did a great job in making the website. But the way you have uploaded your files on github is not good.
Also, The style.css is missing which causes the website unpresentable. 
Also, you can host your website on github for free so that anyone can see it. So you don't need to put the screenshots in the readme secrion.

If you want I can help you out for fixing the code uploaded on github but for that I need the style.css file and your permission.

Feel free to contact me or the same.

All the best,
Cheers.
